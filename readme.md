In the spirit of Awesome List, here's a list of Mormon-related content with a focus on secular material or paradoxical faith-promoting material.

Are Mormons new to you? Here's a [3 min rundown](./Mormonism-in-3-min.md) and the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormons).

> Warning: Religious topics are inherently philosophical and push on personal identities. You may find content here that
is not faith-promoting (a.k.a. faith destroying). Faith promoting sources are welcome if they are historically accurate
or appropriately characterized (i.e. "LDS church admits Book of Abraham is not a translation" links to the Gospel Topics
Essay on the Book of Abraham)
