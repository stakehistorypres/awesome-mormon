## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it. Please squash commits

## Rules
### Format
Format of a link must be:
– [mediaType: <name or very short description>](url) – optional clarification as to why it's worth being on the list `optional tag`

example:
– [website: cesletter](https://cesletter.org) – member lists problematic doctrines and asks church leaders to respond

`mediaType` can be:
- `religious text` (considered scripture, which can include things from other churches. In the LDS context this would only include the "standard works")
- `book`
- `article` (news, online, periodical, court proceeding)
- `journal`
- `speech`
- `anthology`
- `wiki` (wiki only pages. only add these links for broad overviews, like characters)
- `blog`
- `podcast` (any platform. link the episode list)
- `video` (youtube, etc)
- `film` (fictional full length feature film. Link the imdb if unavailable publicly)
- `documentary` (Link the imdb if unavailable publicly)
- `production` (The Book of Mormon Musical)
- `tv series` (Link the imdb if unavailable publicly)
- `tv episode` (a specific episode in a series. Link the imdb if unavailable publicly)
- `image`
- `website` (research foundation homepage, application, anything not already listed above)

`tags` are optional and meant to warn or prepare the more sensitive readers. they can be:
- `secret`: add this for anything that might be considered "sacred not secret."
- `truth claim`: add this if the link is critical of doctrine or accepted history
- `faithful`: add this if the link is generally considered acceptable sources of truth among practicing members
- `r-rated`: if it contains content that does not center around critiquing the doctrine, history, or current culture AND most members would find offensive

### Sections
Feel free to create new subsections if you feel it's worth it. For example, I'd like to further break up polygamy into `Joseph Smith Polygamy` `Polygamy in the Mainline` and `Offshoots` (once I have enough sources)
