# Mormonism in 3 minutes
Mormons are the informal term for followers of Joseph Smith, a 19th century religious figure who produced The Book
of Mormon. The Book of Mormon claims to be Christian Scripture from an ancient American people. Joseph Smith declared
himself a prophet of God and organized a church in New York in 1830, calling it The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day
Saints (LDS Church).

His church quickly grew, and he went West where his followers settled in Missouri and Illinois. He was killed in 1845,
and Brigham Young took over and led most of the followers to what is now Utah. The church there was able to grow
relatively isolated from American influence until the late 1800s. In the mid-1950s the LDS Church worked towards
assimilating into American culture. They consider themselves Christian and count the Bible as part of their canon.

Mormons follow a stricter set of rules than most. Compared to Christians, there are explicit rules around alcohol,
smoking, sex, diet, church attendance, and tithing contributions. Mormons, most notably, have additional rituals found
in their temples, which are exclusive places of worship that are attended outside of regular Sunday worship.

Some challenging issues that believing Mormons face are things like:
- the practice of polygamy (which was halted in the late 1800s)
- the ban on Blacks from officiating or achieving the highest status
- modern science disproving factual claims 
- the mistreatment of LGBT individuals, and
- the wealth of the church

Mormons are led by one prophet (a.k.a president) and his 12 apostles (plus 2 counselors). Lay members organize and run
local Sunday worship in addition to youth groups and men's and women's groups. Their sermons largely focus on the
teachings of newer leaders or those of the Book of Mormon, both of which eventually source from those of the Bible.
